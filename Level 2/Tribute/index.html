                <p>Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev was a Russian chemist and inventor. He is best
                    known for formulating the Periodic Law and creating a version of the periodic table of elements. He
                    used the Periodic Law not only to correct the then-accepted properties of some known elements, such
                    as the valence and atomic weight of uranium, but also to predict the properties of three elements
                    that were yet to be discovered (germanium, gallium and scandium). <br/><br/>
                    <strong><u>Early Life</u></strong><br/><br/>
                    Mendeleev was born in the village of Verkhnie Aremzyani, near Tobolsk in Siberia, to Ivan Pavlovich
                    Mendeleev (1783–1847) and Maria Dmitrievna Mendeleeva (née Kornilieva) (1793–1850).[3][4] Ivan
                    worked as a school principal and a teacher of fine arts, politics and philosophy at the Tambov and
                    Saratov gymnasiums. Ivan's father, Pavel Maximovich Sokolov, was a Russian Orthodox priest from the
                    Tver region. As per the tradition of priests of that time, Pavel's children were given new family
                    names while attending the theological seminary, with Ivan getting the family name Mendeleev after
                    the name of a local landlord.<br/><br/>

                    Maria Kornilieva came from a well-known family of Tobolsk merchants, founders of the first Siberian
                    printing house who traced their ancestry to Yakov Korniliev, a 17th-century posad man turned a
                    wealthy merchant. In 1889, a local librarian published an article in the Tobolsk newspaper where he
                    claimed that Yakov was a baptized Teleut, an ethnic minority known as "white Kalmyks" at the time.
                    Since no sources were provided and no documented facts of Yakov's life were ever revealed,
                    biographers generally dismiss it as a myth. In 1908, shortly after Mendeleev's death, one of his nieces
                    published Family Chronicles. Memories about D. I. Mendeleev where she voiced "a family legend" about
                    Maria's grandfather who married "a Kyrgyz or Tatar beauty whom he loved so much that when she died,
                    he also died from grief". This, however, contradicts the documented family chronicles, and neither of
                    those legends is supported by Mendeleev's autobiography, his daughter's or his wife's memoirs. Yet some Western scholars still refer to Mendeleev's supposed "Mongol", "Tatar",
                    "Tartarian" or simply "Asian" ancestry as a fact.<br/><br/>

                    <strong><u>Periodic Table</u></strong><br/><br/>
                    In 1863, there were 56 known elements with a new element being discovered at a rate of approximately
                    one per year. Other scientists had previously identified periodicity of elements. John Newlands
                    described a Law of Octaves, noting their periodicity according to relative atomic weight in 1864, publishing it
                    in 1865. His proposal identified the potential for new elements such as germanium. The concept was
                    criticized, and his innovation was not recognized by the Society of Chemists until 1887. Another
                    person to propose a periodic table was Lothar Meyer, who published a paper in 1864 describing 28 elements classified by their valence, but with no predictions of new elements.<br/><br/>

                    After becoming a teacher in 1867, Mendeleev wrote Principles of Chemistry (Russian: Основы химии,
                    romanized: Osnovy khimii), which became the definitive textbook of its time. It was published in two
                    volumes between 1868 and 1870, and Mendeleev wrote it as he was preparing a textbook for his
                    course.<br/><br/>
                    This is when he made his most important discovery.As he attempted to classify the elements
                    according to their chemical properties, he noticed patterns that led him to postulate his periodic
                    table; he claimed to have envisioned the complete arrangement of the elements in a dream. <br/><br/>

                    Mendeleev published his periodic table of all known elements and predicted several new elements to
                    complete the table in a Russian-language journal. Only a few months after, Meyer published a
                    virtually identical table in a German-language journal. Mendeleev has the distinction of accurately
                    predicting the properties of what he called ekasilicon, ekaaluminium and ekaboron (germanium,
                    gallium and scandium, respectively).<br/><br/>

                    Mendeleev also proposed changes in the properties of some known elements. Prior to his work, uranium
                    was supposed to have valence 3 and atomic weight about 120. Mendeleev realized that these values did not
                    fit in his periodic table, and doubled both to valence 6 and atomic weight 240 (close to the modern
                    value of 238)<br/><br/>

                    For his predicted three elements, he used the prefixes of eka, dvi, and tri (Sanskrit one, two,
                    three) in their naming. Mendeleev questioned some of the currently accepted atomic weights (they could be
                    measured only with a relatively low accuracy at that time), pointing out that they did not
                    correspond to those suggested by his Periodic Law. He noted that tellurium has a higher atomic weight than iodine,
                    but he placed them in the right order, incorrectly predicting that the accepted atomic weights at the
                    time
                    were at fault. He was puzzled about where to put the known lanthanides, and predicted the existence
                    of
                    another row to the table which were the actinides which were some of the heaviest in atomic weight.
                    Some
                    people dismissed Mendeleev for predicting that there would be more elements, but he was proven to be
                    correct when Ga (gallium) and Ge (germanium) were found in 1875 and 1886 respectively, fitting
                    perfectly
                    into the two missing spaces.<br/><br/>

                    By using Sanskrit prefixes to name "missing" elements, Mendeleev may have recorded his debt to the
                    Sanskrit grammarians of ancient India, who had created theories of language based on their discovery
                    of
                    the two-dimensional patterns of speech sounds (exemplified by the Śivasūtras in Pāṇini's Sanskrit
                    grammar). Mendeleev was a friend and colleague of the Sanskritist Otto von Böhtlingk, who was
                    preparing
                    the second edition of his book on Pāṇini at about this time, and Mendeleev wished to honor Pāṇini
                    with his nomenclature.<br/><br/>

                    The original draft made by Mendeleev would be found years later and published under the name
                    Tentative
                    System of Elements. <br/><br/>

                    Dmitri Mendeleev is often referred to as the Father of the Periodic Table. He called his table or
                    matrix, "the Periodic System". <br/><br/>
